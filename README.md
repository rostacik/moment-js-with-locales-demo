# [momentjs](http://momentjs.com/ "momentjs") demo to showcase problem with localized names of months and days #

----------

All pages use the very same snippet of JavaScript bound to click of a button:

```javascript
moment.locale('sk');
alert(moment("6-25-1995", "MM-DD-YYYY").format('dddd, MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss'));
```

Which essentially does this :

- switch momentjs to Slovak locale
- alert parsed date of 25th of December 1995 to day, month day. year, hours:minutes:seconds

The problem lies in encoding of received .js file and I will elaborate a bit here what we can do about it.

# the project structure #

This demo consists of **following HTML files** :

- **index.html** - root page with links to each demo page,
- **indexcdn.html** - moment js with locale loaded from cdnjs with simple script tag (locale in JS are malformed),
- **indexcdwithcharset.html** - the same file, but script tag is enforcing charset to be utf-8 (locale in JS file are all OK),
- **localconvertedfile.html** - using local moment-with-locales-with-signature.js that has been converted to UTF8 with BOM (by me in Notepad++),
- **localforcedutf.html** - using original moment-with-locales-orig.js but with property charset="utf-8" in script tag,
- **localoriginalfile.html** - using original moment-with-locales-orig.js - the very same was as momentjs has in their docs : [browser script tag link](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/use-it/browser/),
- **remotefile.html** - loading hosted momentjs file with Content-Type:application/javascript; charset=utf-8 headers.

and **JS files** :

- **moment-with-locales-orig.js** - original momentjs with locales downloaded from here [http://momentjs.com/downloads/moment-with-locales.js](http://momentjs.com/downloads/moment-with-locales.js) originally encoded as UTF8 without [BOM - byte order mark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark).
- **moment-with-locales-with-signature.js** - the very same file but converted to UTF8 [BOM - byte order mark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark).

# making it work #
So essentially there are 3 ways how can we make momentjs with locale versions of names work :

1. use **response header Content-Type set to : `application/javascript; charset=utf-8`** (usually this is just application/javascript),
2. convert **momentjs** to **UTF8 with BOM**,
3. use original file with content header just set to application/javascript but **set charset="utf-8" in script tag**.
